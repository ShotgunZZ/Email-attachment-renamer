# Gmail Attachment Renamer Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: March 23, 2025*

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Gmail Attachment Renamer ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles user data. Gmail Attachment Renamer is a browser extension designed to rename Gmail attachments using a customizable format including date, sender email, and original filename.

## Data Collection and Usage

**Gmail Attachment Renamer does not collect, store, or transmit any user data to external servers.** 

The extension operates entirely on your local device and processes data only as necessary to perform its single purpose: renaming Gmail attachment downloads.

### Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect or process:
- Email content
- Contact information
- Browsing history
- Personal information
- Authentication credentials
- Financial information
- Location data

### Local Data Storage

Gmail Attachment Renamer stores only the following information locally in your browser's storage:

1. **Filename Pattern Preferences**: Your preferred pattern for renaming files (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD_SenderName_OriginalFilename").
2. **Temporary Download Information**: During the download process, the extension temporarily stores information about the current download to properly rename it. This information is cleared after the download is complete.

This information never leaves your browser and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

## Gmail Access

While Gmail Attachment Renamer requires access to Gmail to function properly, it:
- Only reads the minimal information needed to rename attachments (sender email, date, attachment name)
- Does not read email content beyond identifying attachment information
- Does not modify or delete any emails
- Does not send any data from your Gmail to external servers

## Third-Party Access

Gmail Attachment Renamer does not:
- Sell or rent user data to third parties
- Share any information with third parties
- Use or transfer data for purposes unrelated to its function
- Use data for advertising, analytics, or tracking

## Data Retention

Since no user data is collected or stored on external servers, there is no data retention period. Your filename pattern preferences remain in your browser's local storage until you:
- Change your preferences
- Uninstall the extension
- Clear your browser data

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date.
